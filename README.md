# Robot Path Planning Algorithms

Implementation and evaluation of search algorithms for mobile robot path planning in a 2D environment. This repository includes Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A* Search algorithms, implemented under both 'tree search' and 'graph search' paradigms.
